% For: seanpm2001/Learn-MATLAB
% About:
% I decided to make MATLAB the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-MATLAB) as MATLAB is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the MATLAB programming language. It only makes sense to MATLAB the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
